**An introduction to Spark and what role it plays in Big Data** 

When it comes to big data, processing speed is a big factor when choosing which software to use. Imagine trying to query hundreds of terabytes of data in MySQL. MySQL only uses one CPU core but Spark uses all cores and uses parallel computing to run queries. In fact, queries on Spark tend to process 10 times faster than on MySQL! Spark can also split up a query into smaller queries and run those across different servers. If a company manages terabytes of data a day, they may want a way to run analytics or apply a machine learning algorithm on the data. Big data software such as Spark help achieve this. 

For those of you who are familiar with big data, you may be wondering how Hadoop plays a role in all of this. Before Spark was introduced in around 2015-2016, Hadoop was used in big data work. Hadoop aims to accomplish what Spark does but most engineers agree that Spark is more advanced, faster, and is now more widespread in the industry. One disadvantage of Spark however is that it does not have a native file system (unlike Hadoop). Nonetheless, in a time where industries demand real-time data to be used in marketing or machine learning, Spark is dominating when it comes to big data.
